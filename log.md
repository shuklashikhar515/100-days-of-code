# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 23, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Created a variable sized array using vectors in C++

**Thoughts:** I faced struggle at very first while doing the vectors since it was my first attempt. After taking help from one of mmy friends and studying articles on vectors, at last i succesfully made the program.
